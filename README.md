Oregon Trail-inspired, text-based, choose-your-own-adventure racing game where you do random races (drifting, drag racing, circuit racing, and sprints) at varying difficulties.

Win and save cash prizes to upgrade your car and its parts in order to dominate your opponents.

Experience random events such as car troubles, hidden money caches, and abandoned cars with useable part upgrades as you traverse the US and eventually the rest of the world!
