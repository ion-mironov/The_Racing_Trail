The Racing Trail is a racing game inspired by The Oregon Trail and is a text-based, choose-your-own-adventure where you can do random races (drifting, drag racing, circuit racing, and sprints) at varying difficulties. Winning races will net you cash prizes and/or parts that you can use to upgrade your car. Along your journey, you'll experience random events such as having car troubles, finding hidden money caches, and even finding abandoned cars with useable parts!

You will start in the USA but will be able to travel across the globe as you progress. But be careful, as you'll have to be mindful of not only your location but the temperature and humidity, as well, to ensure that your car is tuned properly so that you're able to be up to the challenge to defeat your opponents.
